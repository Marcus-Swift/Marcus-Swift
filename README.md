🚀 Marcus Adigun — Aspiring iOS Developer (Swift + AI)
Hey, I’m Marcus. I’m learning Swift and SwiftUI to build iOS apps, and I’m exploring how to plug in AI (Core ML, Vision) as I grow. I’m early in the journey, focused on solid fundamentals and shipping small projects.

🔭 Current Focus
Swift language fundamentals (Swift 6 mindset)

SwiftUI layouts, state, navigation

Xcode workflows, Git/GitHub basics

Intro to on-device ML with Core ML (beginner experiments)

🧰 Tech I Use (so far)
Languages: Swift (learning), Python (basic), SQL (basic), HTML/CSS (basic)

Tools: Xcode, Git/GitHub, Figma

Back-end (exposure): FastAPI, PostgreSQL

📚 Learning Goals (Next 3–6 Months)
Build 3–5 small iOS apps (lists, API, offline storage)

Add Core ML to a simple SwiftUI app (classification or recommendations)

Explore visionOS later (stretch goal)

Publish at least 1 app to TestFlight

🧪 Projects
Student Manager (with AI assistant) — web prototype; planning an iOS version

SwiftUI Playground — components, patterns, and tiny demos (in progress)

Soil Classifier — ML prototype; exploring on-device version

✅ What I’m Doing Right Now
Daily Swift practice

Rebuilding small features from Apple sample apps

Documenting progress in issues/notes
